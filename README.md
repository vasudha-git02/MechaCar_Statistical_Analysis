## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The strongest contributor of non-random variance seems to be the vehicle length with a p-value of 2.60e-12. The other strong contributor of non-random variance is the ground clearance with a p-value of 5.21e-8.

The slope of the linear model is not zero. We can see that the slope coefficients contain significant non-zero values (vehicle length, ground clearance, and AWD), and the p-values are less than the significance level of p=0.05.

Our r^2 value is 0.7149, which means the model does have good predictive power for the mpg.
